                        <p class = "description">The concept of artificial consciousness could be best described as being abstract, frankly due to the fact that it has not been practically achieved yet. I previously touched upon the subject within my Blade Runner article, and it’s certainly one of the most integrating concepts within the artificial intelligence industry, due to the sheer amount of possibilities it can introduce.</p>

                        <p class = "description">Machine learning consists of various core concepts and fundamentals, with the development of many algorithms being completely necessary to categorize data or predict various outcomes. One category of algorithms that is most commonly used are decision tree algorithms, which are utilized to construct various types of trees to filter data through. The purpose of developing any type of decision tree is to intake a dataset with key information associated with it and then filter that data to determine categories or predictions that data can be identified with. </p>

                            intelligence”, you might think of media portrayal of it like “I, Robot” which could make you imagine it as a horrific science fiction fantasy, but AI is a very real branch of computer science/mathematics that is used every single day in academia, industry, and your own personal cell phone, computer, tablet, etc.</p>

                        <p class = "description">Our first in-depth look into a film focuses on none other than the original Blade Runner, first released in 1982 and directed by the infamous Ridley Scott. The film is without a doubt one of the most remarkable and impactful works ever released for cinema, even leading to another critical success with its 2017 sequel, Blade Runner: 2049. For those who have not seen the film, no need to worry, there won’t be any major spoilers.</p>
