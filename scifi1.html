                        <p>“I’ve seen things you people wouldn’t believe. Attack ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion. I watched C-beams glitter in the dark near the Tannhauser gate. All those moments will be lost in time, like tears in rain.”</p>
                        <p>Our first in-depth look into a film focuses on none other than the original Blade Runner, first released in 1982 and directed by the infamous Ridley Scott. The film is without a doubt one of the most remarkable and impactful works ever released for cinema, even leading to another critical success with its 2017 sequel, Blade Runner: 2049. For those who have not seen the film, no need to worry, there won’t be any major spoilers. This is simply an in-depth analysis and appreciation as to why Blade Runner remains one of the most impactful films in the science fiction genre.</p>
                        <p>As a quick recap, the setting of Blade Runner takes place on Earth in the year 2019, albeit much more futuristic than reality. The plot focuses on the protagonist Rick Deckard, portrayed by Harrison Ford, ordered to track down beings known as Replicants: robots created solely for the purpose of making the lives of humans easier. As the narrative progresses, the line between human and Replicant blurs, heavily impacting the plot and the viewer in significant ways.</p>

                        <p>The film’s presentation is quite possibly my favorite aspect of the science fiction classic. Despite being decades since its initial release, the motion picture still manages to be immersive in terms of portraying Scott’s futuristic vision. The only exception to this is the occasional 80’s-esq monitors being used in the year 2019, showing how much our vision of technology has evolved since 1982. However, any visual discrepancy is immediately overshadowed by the auditory masterpiece that is the film’s soundtrack, composed by the exceptionally talented Vangelis. Listening to the tracks alone can make those listening feel like they are in another world, and that feeling is only enhanced after watching the film. At some points, the music sounds oddly relaxing like smooth jazz or at other times haunting through its vocals, with the purpose of reminding you the kind of world Blade Runner truly is: a future filled with incredible depth and spirit.</p>
                        <p>The philosophical beliefs presented in Blade Runner is perhaps what stays with viewers the most, due to its incredibly thought provoking nature. These concepts are mainly attributed to the Replicants and their actions that contradict the very reason they were created. At many instances throughout the film, it is almost impossible to distinguish the difference between the machines and humans. Replicants are rooted from the desire of being free and they believe that by disobeying direct orders by acting as humans they can achieve their goal.</p>
                        <p>It’s an understatement to say that Blade Runner still holds up in the current day, as it manages to get better with age. With every advancement our society makes towards robotics and artificial consciousness, the film challenges viewers to define the difference between humans and machines capable of thought.</p>
