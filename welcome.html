                        <h2>Welcome to our Launch!</h2>
                        <p>Hello and welcome to ViaforaChachkoAI.com!</p>
                        <p>This site represents a fun project that we wanted to develop to share our passion for the artificial intelligence field. Our mission statement is to bridge the divide between newcomers to the field and the complicated theoretics/applications of AI through articles ranging from basic informative content to fun science fiction adaptations. It seems that artificial intelligence is only growing by the day and has definitely gotten our attention. Weâ€™re still learning more as time goes on, but we wanted to showcase some of the reasons we love AI. Since this site was developed entirely by ourselves there will certainly be some learning curves and fine-tuning, but we thank you for joining us on this adventure!</p>
                        <p>Our plan is to release 2-3 articles weekly on new topics in the Artificial Intelligence field, as well as science fiction analysis related to AI. We look forward to expanding our area of interest as we learn more about AI, its uses, and impact on society. If you have any suggestions, feel free to contact us <a href = about_us.html>here!</a></p>
